# AI Game Routing
A more in-depth fork of https://github.com/minerharry/neat_game_testing, attempting to teach a neural network how to play Super Mario Bros 1.

NOTE: for the game, I am using marblexu's (https://github.com/marblexu) awesome Python Mario Bros game, at https://github.com/marblexu/PythonSuperMario/. I have torn it apart to optimize and fit it with my infrastructure :).
